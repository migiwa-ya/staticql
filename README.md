# StaticQL (WIP)

**StaticQL (Static File Query Layer)** is a lightweight static data layer that allows you to query and join Markdown / YAML / JSON files directly. Queries are written using standard TypeScript syntax with full type inference support. While designed for small to medium-sized Jamstack and API projects, StaticQL is flexible enough to be used in a wide variety of contexts.
